            <h1 class="center"> Effective interface design?</h1>
            <h2 class="center">January 7, 2016</h2>
            <p>There are so many interfaces around us today, it is hard to pick just one that I use often. However one that stands out to me is the Sketch app interface on my Macbook. This interface has allowed me to create website mockups, banners, buttons, and even edit photos pain free. Now all the functions I listed may just sound like things you can do on Photoshop, but Sketch is more than that. Even though I have used Photoshop a lot and it has a lot of powerful tools, I&#39;ve grown to prefer sketch because of its friendlier usability. Its interface is organized differently than Photoshop. There are not as many drop own menus or tightly spaced icons for tools. It has more convenient options to add or edit shapes and artboards. It also is easier to access layers and isolate objects within a layer. I find myself being able to create mockups much faster and without getting frustrated from the interface. This may seem miniscule...but all of these little short cuts add up and become life savers when working on projects under short deadlines. </p>
            <p> In all, I admire the Sketch interface because it&#39;s easy to use, has a clear organized layout, and helps me produce mockups faster and more efficiently. This interface helps me process and produce things very fast and I enjoy that sense of instant gratification. I think that&#39;s one important element about an effective interface is that whatever the interface it is, it generally makes the user feel good or leaves the user with a good impression. </p>
